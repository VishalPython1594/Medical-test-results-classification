# 🏥 Medical Test Results Classification - Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered medical test classification system** that predicts whether a patient’s test result is **Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive** based on key patient information. The model uses **Random Forest Classification** to analyze features such as **age, gender, medical conditions, blood type, admission type, and medication usage.**  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- 🩺 **Predicts test results** based on patient details.  
- 🔍 **Uses a trained Random Forest Model** for classification.  
- 🖥️ **User-friendly Streamlit interface** for easy interaction.  
- 📊 **Handles categorical medical data** through feature encoding.  
- 🚀 **Deployed as a web app** for real-time classification.

## 📊 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Backend)  
- **Streamlit** (Web UI)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Model - Random Forest Classifier)  
- **Pandas** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)  
- **Hugging Face Cloud** (Deployment Platform)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishalPython1594/Medical-test-results-classification.git
cd Medical-Test-Classification
```
### **2️⃣ Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### **3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ User enters patient details (e.g., age, gender, medical condition, blood type).
2️⃣ The input is preprocessed & encoded into the correct format.
3️⃣ A trained Random Forest Model predicts whether the test result is:

  ✅ Normal
  ⚠️ Abnormal
  ❓ Inconclusive
  
4️⃣ The prediction is displayed interactively in the web UI.

## 🖥️ Usage
1. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run appr.py
```
2. Enter patient details (e.g., age, gender, medical condition, admission type).
3. Click **"Predict"** to classify the test result.
4. View the AI-generated medical classification.
